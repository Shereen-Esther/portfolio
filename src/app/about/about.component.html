            I'm Shereen Jubal</h1>

            It's challenging to sum up "Tell me about yourself" in a few lines, but allow me to try to cram 2 decades of
            who I am into this section. I am Shereen Jubal, an extrovert, who loves to interact and communicate with new
            people. Because I enjoy problem solving in my daily life (which I believe is an in-built talent for any
            Indian child), programming has always piqued my interest and as a result, I acquired Master of Science in
            Computer Science at Wright State University.

        <p class="content">
            Luck has never favored me and so I strongly believe in hard
            work. I love to take on new challenges that push me beyond my comfort zone. I'm passionate about coding and
            would learn any language. I aspire to become a software engineer and explore new domains. In the vast
            tapestry of my life journey, the threads of outdoor activities stand out as vibrant and defining—a flame
            that burns brightly and drives me to seek adventure. “In a world where we can be anything, be kind” is one
            quote I believe in and try to uphold in my life. I have made it through this life with the help of God's
            guidance, a supportive family, and great friends. Life has taught me a lot, both academically and
            personally, over the years and I hope it continues to mold me into the person I aspire to be.
